abstract: A prototype microwave breast imaging system is used to scan a small group
  of patients. The prototype implements a monostatic radar-based approach to microwave
  imaging and utilizes ultra-wideband signals. Eight patients were successfully scanned,
  and several of the resulting images show responses consistent with the clinical
  patient histories. These encouraging results motivate further studies of microwave
  imaging for breast health assessment.
