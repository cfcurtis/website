title: Pattern Projector
summary: |
  Pattern projector is a free and open source web app that quickly calibrates projectors for sewing patterns. It also has tools for stitching together multiple page patterns, changing line thickness, inverting colors, flipping/rotating patterns, and more. 
  
  My main contribution to date was adding the ability to save a stitched PDF.
