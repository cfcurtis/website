title: Inkscape
summary: |
  Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting.

  My main contribution to date was a modification of the PDF import algorithm to reduce the number of clipping paths in the resulting document.
