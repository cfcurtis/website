abstract: Print-at-home PDF sewing patterns have gained popularity over the last decade
  and now represent a significant proportion of the home sewing pattern market. Recently,
  an all-digital workflow has emerged through the use of ceiling-mounted projectors,
  allowing for patterns to be projected directly onto fabric. However, PDF patterns
  produced for printing are not suitable for projecting. This paper presents PDFStitcher,
  an open-source cross-platform graphical tool that enables end users to modify PDF
  sewing patterns for use with a projector. The key functionality of PDFStitcher is
  described, followed by a brief discussion on the future of sewing pattern file formats
  and information processing.
