abstract: Sewing patterns are a form of technical document, requiring expertise to
  author and understand. Digital patterns are typically produced and sold as PDFs
  with human-interpretable vector graphics, but there is little consistency or machine-readable
  metadata in these documents. A custom file format would enable digital pattern manipulation
  tools to enhance or replace a paper based workflow. In this vision paper, basic
  sewing pattern components and modification processes are introduced, and the limitations
  of current PDF patterns are highlighted. Next, an XML-based sewing pattern document
  format is proposed to take advantage of the inherent relationships between different
  pattern components. Finally, document security and authenticity considerations are
  discussed.
