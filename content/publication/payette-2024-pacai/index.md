abstract: Rendering of complex scenes from software such as Blender is time consuming,  but
  corresponding auxiliary data such as depth or object segmentation maps are relatively
  fast to generate. The auxiliary data also provides a wealth of information for tasks
  such as optical flow prediction. In this paper we present the QuickRender dataset,
  a collection of procedurally generated scenes rendered into over 5,000 sequential
  image triplets along with accompanying auxiliary data. The goal of this dataset
  is to provide a diversity of scenes and motion while maintaining realistic behaviours.
  A sample application using this dataset to perform single image super resolution
  is also presented. The dataset and related source code can be found at https://github.com/MP-mtroyal/MetaSRGAN.
