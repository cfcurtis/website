 abstract = {Print-at-home PDF sewing patterns have gained popularity over the last decade and now represent a significant proportion of the home sewing pattern market. Recently, an all-digital workflow has emerged through the use of ceiling-mounted projectors, allowing for patterns to be projected directly onto fabric. However, PDF patterns produced for printing are not suitable for projecting. This paper presents PDFStitcher, an open-source cross-platform graphical tool that enables end users to modify PDF sewing patterns for use with a projector. The key functionality of PDFStitcher is described, followed by a brief discussion on the future of sewing pattern file formats and information processing.},
