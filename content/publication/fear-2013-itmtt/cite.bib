 abstract = {A prototype microwave breast imaging system is used to scan a small group of patients. The prototype implements a monostatic radar-based approach to microwave imaging and utilizes ultra-wideband signals. Eight patients were successfully scanned, and several of the resulting images show responses consistent with the clinical patient histories. These encouraging results motivate further studies of microwave imaging for breast health assessment.},
