abstract: The portable document format (PDF) is both versatile and complex, with a
  specification exceeding well over a thousand pages. For independent developers writing
  software that reads, displays, or transforms PDFs, it is difficult to comprehensively
  account for all of the potential variations that might exist in the wild. Compounding
  this problem are the usage agreements that often accompany purchased and proprietary
  PDFs, preventing end users from uploading a troublesome document as part of a bug
  report and limiting the set of test cases that can be made public for open source
  development. In this paper, pdf-mangler is presented as a solution to this problem.
  The goal of pdf-mangler is to remove information in the form of text, images, and
  vector graphics while retaining as much of the document structure and general visual
  appearance as possible. The intention is for pdf-mangler to be deployed as part
  of an automated bug reporting tool for PDF software.
